# ATTENTION! If you're adding a rule to ignore - update the list below with code description and (optionally) the reason
# why it is disabled

# Just try to avoid non-ascii symbols in code at all (unless it is really needed to use them)
# C101: Coding magic comment not found

# Obsolete, see https://lintlyci.github.io/Flake8Rules/rules/W503.html
# W503: line break before binary operator

# Docstrings are not required (but advisable)
# D100: Missing docstring in public module
# D101: Missing docstring in public class
# D102: Missing docstring in public method
# D103: Missing docstring in public function
# D104: Missing docstring in public package
# D105: Missing docstring in magic method
# D106: Missing docstring in public nested class
# D107: Missing docstring in __init__

# Disabling some low-level bandit warning, that would often cause failures for no reason
# S311: Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes.
# S404: Consider possible security implications associated with subprocess module.
# S603: subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input

# Don't insist on this rule
# Z306: Found class without a base class

# It is useful for multiline strings. Just avoid such concatenation for single line ones.
# Z326: Found implicit string concatenation

# Sometimes it is more clear to have `else` branch. Just be reasonable.
# Z457: Found redundant returning `else` statement
